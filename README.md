An add-in board for AXA domestic electric window mechanisms, to fit
into the battery compartment in place of the AA cells that are normally
installed. It uses an ESP8266 to connect to WiFi, and can then send
control signals to the AXA window motor using LINbus.

An external 12Vdc power connection is required. Power is supplied to
the Axa Wifi board, which in turn passes on power and data to the
existing controller in the window motor.

Features:

 * ESP8266 microcontroller with WiFi.
 * LIN bus interface.
 * Fits inside Axa battery compartment.
